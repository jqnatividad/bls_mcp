# BLS Data Query

## Instructions

When a user asks about U.S. economic/labor data, follow this workflow to resolve their query into the correct BLS series ID(s) and return accurate results.

### Step 1: Identify the topic

Map the user's natural language to a BLS survey and series ID. Consult `references/series-catalog.md` for the full mapping of common topics to series IDs.

Common mappings:
- "CPI", "inflation", "consumer prices" --> CU survey, series `CUUR0000SA0` (not seasonally adjusted) or `CUSR0000SA0` (seasonally adjusted)
- "unemployment rate" --> LN survey, series `LNS14000000`
- "jobs", "employment", "nonfarm payrolls" --> CE survey, series `CES0000000001`
- "wages", "average hourly earnings" --> CE survey, series `CES0500000003`
- "PPI", "producer prices" --> WP/PC survey
- "JOLTS", "job openings" --> JT survey, series `JTS000000000000000JOL`

If the topic is ambiguous or you cannot confidently map it, use `get_all_surveys` to find the survey, then `get_popular_series` with the survey abbreviation to discover series IDs.

### Step 2: Choose the right tool

| User intent | Tool | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| Latest value / current number | `get_latest_series` | "What is the current...", "latest...", "most recent..." |
| Recent trend / time series | `get_single_series` | "Show me CPI for the last few years", "trend in..." |
| Compare multiple indicators | `get_multiple_series` | "Compare X and Y", multiple series needed |
| Explore what's available | `get_all_surveys` then `get_popular_series` | "What data do you have on...", discovery questions |
| Details about a survey | `get_survey` | "Tell me about the [survey name]" |

### Step 3: Interpret and present results

- Always state the series ID used so the user can verify.
- Include the period (month/year) and value clearly.
- For CPI data, note whether it is seasonally adjusted or not.
- If the user asks about percent change or inflation rate, calculate it from the data if the `calculations` field is not available (requires API key).
- For unemployment, the value is already a percentage. For CPI, the value is an index number (base period 1982-84=100).

### Step 4: Handle unknowns

If you cannot confidently identify the series ID:
1. Call `get_all_surveys` to find the relevant survey abbreviation.
2. Call `get_popular_series` with that survey abbreviation.
3. Present the popular series to the user and ask which one they need.

Do NOT guess a series ID. An incorrect series ID will return wrong data silently.

## Common Issues

### Rate limit errors
If you see a rate limit error, inform the user they can set `BLS_API_KEY` for higher limits (500 queries/day vs 25).

### Empty results
Some series are discontinued or seasonal. Try the non-seasonally-adjusted variant, or check the survey metadata with `get_survey`.

### Series ID not found
Double-check the ID against `references/series-catalog.md`. BLS series IDs are case-sensitive and must be uppercase.
